# oc man plugin

This is an experimental plugin for the [OpenShift command line tool](https://github.com/openshift/oc)
to provide a [man page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) like experience.

## how to build

Run `make build`, or for a containerized build use `./hack/container-run.sh make build`. The output
will be in the `bin` directory.
